\section{Validation Activities} \label{sec:activities}

Here we detail the proposed validation activities covering all aspects of the  LSST} science drivers outlined in \citeds{ivezic2008} and the  LSST science requirements document \citeds{LSE-17}

\subsection{Cross science driver validations}

\subsubsection{Catalogue  Validation}

In-depth analysis of the contents of the  LSST catalogues to detect anomolies, problems in individual Objects and to flag or filter them prior to a release. 

An independent validation to assess the quality of the  LSST data, precision of the  astrometry, photometry, 



\subsection{Cataloging the Solar System}

\subsection{Variable SKy}

\subsection{Galaxies}

\subsection{Cosmology}
