\section{Introduction}  \label{sec:intro}

This document provides the Science Validation Plan for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). 
This Science Validation Plan describes the plans for validating the data products produced by the Rubin Observatory LSST Science Pipelines. 

\subsection{Objectives}   label{ssec:objectives} 

We describe the approach to scientific validation of the LSST data products together with the various constraints and limitations. 
We present the validation program and timeline for the partially and fully integrated Rubin Observatory system.
